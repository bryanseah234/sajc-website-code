Janessa demonstrated resilience and courage, as she continually stepped out of her comfort zone to broaden her experience. Janessa also received many academic awards for her excellent academic results throughout her time in College.

Such thoughtfulness and empathy also extended to the wider community, and Rena was an active participant in many class and College Service Learning projects. A critical thinker and effective communicator, Rena was an invaluable member in class discussions and group work.
